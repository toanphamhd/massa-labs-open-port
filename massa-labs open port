How to make your node routable
make sure the computer on which the node is running has a static public IP address (IPv4 or IPv6). You can retrieve the public IP address of your computer by opening https://api.ipify.org
if the computer running the node is behind a router/NAT, you will need to configure your router:
if the router uses DHCP, the MAC address of the computer running the node must be set to have a permanent DHCP lease (a local IP address that never changes, usually of form 192.168.X.XX)
incoming connections on TCP ports 31244 and 31245 must be directed towards the local IP address of the computer running the node
setup the firewall on your computer to allow incoming TCP connections on ports 31244 and 31245 (example: ufw allow 31244 && ufw allow 31245 on Ubuntu, or set up the Windows Firewall on Windows)
edit file massa-node/config/config.toml (create it if absent) with the following contents:
[network]
routable_ip = "AAA.BBB.CCC.DDD"
where AAA.BBB.CCC.DDD should be replaced with your public IP address (not the local one !). IPV6 is also supported.
run the massa node
you can then test if your ports are open by typing your public IP address and port 31244 in https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/ (then again with port 31245)
Once your node is routable, you need to send the public IP address of your node to the Discord bot. You first need to register to the staking reward program (see the last step below).
